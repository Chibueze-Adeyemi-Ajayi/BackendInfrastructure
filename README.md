## Introduction

The Proxy Server Application is designed to route network requests between clients and servers. It intercepts requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate destination server, while also handling responses and routing them back to the clients.

## Features

- **Request Forwarding**: The proxy server forwards incoming requests to the target servers.
- **Response Handling**: It captures and relays responses from target servers back to clients.
- **Caching**: Caches frequently accessed resources to optimize performance.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests across multiple servers for load balancing.
- **Security**: Acts as a firewall between clients and servers, enhancing security by hiding the server's identity.
- **Logging**: Records transaction logs for monitoring and analysis.

## Usage

To use the proxy server application, follow these steps:

1. **Install**: Install the proxy server application on your desired server.
2. **Configure**: Configure the proxy settings, including target server addresses and caching preferences.
3. **Run**: Start the proxy server application.
4. **Client Configuration**: Configure clients to route requests through the proxy server.
